    dc:description """MiTO, the Mention Typing Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL. Its aim is to enable the formalization of the concept of mentions.  

The mentions may be either explicit (e.g. as when well stated into an article "Dr. Johnson's groundbreaking research on climate change") or implicit (e.g. such as discussing "seminal studies in the field").

MiTO contains the object property mito:mentions and its inverse mito:isMentionedBy. More than that it also contains a few sibiling propertie which try to characterize the mention itself. Restrictions of domain and range are limited to the bare minimum in order to enhance interoperability with other SPAR ontologies and to allow the user to use this ontoloy as freely as possible."""@en ;
